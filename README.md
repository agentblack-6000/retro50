# retro50
#### Project Description:
A Flask web app implementing a retrospective revision timetable for Harvard's CS50's final project.

### How do I get started?
Simply create an account and start adding subjects to your timetable, which will be displayed on the home page. See the about page or the Github project wiki for more information.

### How do I clone the repository?
Run the following command-
```
git clone https://github.com/agentblack-6000/retro50.git
```

### Project Updates
This web app was built as a final project for CS50, although future plans entail-
- Using PostgreSQL and the actual SQLAlchemy library instead of SQLite and the CS50 library
- Adding fancier JS to detect password strength
- A small forum (also implemented by PostgreSQL) for students to publish helpful resources and questions
